<p>D is the best: super.fly(place) invokes Bird's fly method, so produces fly behavior like other Birds.&nbsp; A would also work, but is does not take advantage of inheritance, and would be incorrect if you change the flying behavior of Birds by modifying Bird's fly method.</p>

<p>Answer A is the easiest to rule out -- it gives&nbsp;<code>CellPhone</code> two superclasses, which is not permitted in Java.</p>
<p>C is not the best choice because it doesn't capture the relationships among the various items. D captures some of the relationships but not all (for example, it's missing the relationship between <code>PictureTaker&nbsp;</code>and <code>Camera</code>).</p>
<p>Answers B and E are very similar -- they focus on the question of which items should be modeled by interfaces and which by classes. B is a better choice for several reasons. Pagers, phones, and cameras all have both behaviors and data -- for example, the list of phone messages for a phone and the ability to take pictures for both phones and cameras -- while PictureTaker and Communicator correspond to behaviors. In addition, defining PictureTaker as an interface allows us to capture the fact that a cell phone is a product, a picture taker, *and* a communicator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Answer A is the easiest to rule out -- it gives&nbsp;<code>CellPhone</code> two superclasses, which is not permitted in Java.</p>
<p>C is not the best choice because it doesn't capture the relationships among the various items. D captures some of the relationships but not all (for example, it's missing the relationship between <code>PictureTaker&nbsp;</code>and <code>Camera</code>).</p>
<p>Answers B and E are very similar -- they focus on the question of which items should be modeled by interfaces and which by classes. B is a better choice for several reasons. Pagers, phones, and cameras all have both behaviors and data -- for example, the list of phone messages for a phone and the ability to take pictures for both phones and cameras -- while PictureTaker and Communicator correspond to behaviors. In addition, defining PictureTaker as an interface allows us to capture the fact that a cell phone is a product, a picture taker, *and* a communicator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this case the negatively phrased line of code ""if( !(aiTable[i] % 2))"" is an alternative way of&nbsp; expressing the more common phrasing of a modulus arithmetic expression as given below</p>
<p>If you wanted to know if a number was odd or even, you could use modulus to quickly tell you by asking for the remainder of the number when divided by 2.</p>
<p>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</p>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int num;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>
<p>return 0;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>The key line is the one that performs the modulus operation: ""num % 2 == 0"". A number is even if and only if it is divisible by two, and a number is divisible by another only if there is no remainder.</p>

","
<p>the rules of precedence</p>
",<p>the data type of a variable</p>,<p>the scope of a variable</p>,"","","","","","
<p>Scope is the largest region of program text in which a name can potentially be used without qualification to refer to an entity; that is, the largest region in which the name potentially is valid. Broadly speaking, scope is the general context used to differentiate the meanings of entity names. The rules for scope combined with those for name resolution enable the compiler to determine whether a reference to an identifier is legal at a given point in a file.</p>
<p>The scope of a declaration and the visibility of an identifier are related but distinct concepts. Scope is the mechanism by which it is possible to limit the visibility of declarations in a program. The visibility of an identifier is the region of program text from which the object associated with the identifier can be legally accessed. Scope can exceed visibility, but visibility cannot exceed scope. Scope exceeds visibility when a duplicate identifier is used in an inner declarative region, thereby hiding the object declared in the outer declarative region. The original identifier cannot be used to access the first object until the scope of the duplicate identifier (the lifetime of the second object) has ended.</p>

<p>In the worst case, every time we partition the list, we divide it into two parts, one of size 0 and one of size n-1 (plus the pivot element). This would happen, for example, if all the elements of the list are equal, or if the list is already sorted and you choose the left-most element as your pivot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'd have to partition the list n times, because each time the pivot element is the only one that gets put in place. &nbsp;The first time we compare the pivot element with all n-1 other elements. The second time, we compare the new pivot with n-2 other elements, and so forth down to n - (n-1).
